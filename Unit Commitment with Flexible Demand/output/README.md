# Sensitivity Analysis – Project Summary

This repository contains the results of the sensitivity analyses conducted on:

- **Flexibility Index**
- **Discomfort Costs**

The purpose of these analyses is to understand how changes in key parameters affect system performance, costs, and social welfare, and to identify the parameters with the most significant impact.

## Contents

- `flexibility_sensitivity.xlsx` – Sensitivity analysis results for the flexibility index.  
- `discomfort_cost_sensitivity.xlsx` – Sensitivity analysis results for discomfort costs.  
- `plots/` – Graphical representation of the sensitivity analyses, including:
  - Demand curves  
  - Electricity prices  
  - Profit  
  - Utility start-up and shut-down costs  
  - Social welfare  

- `README.md` – This file, including methodology and conclusions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Flexibility Index
- Highly sensitive to changes in electricity prices and demand patterns, indicating that small variations can significantly affect system flexibility.  
- Start-up and shut-down costs of utilities have a moderate impact on flexibility.  
- Social welfare outcomes are indirectly affected by flexibility changes, emphasizing the importance of optimal management.

### 2. Discomfort Costs
- Discomfort costs are primarily influenced by demand curves and electricity price variations.  
- High start-up or shut-down costs can also increase overall system costs, impacting social welfare.  
- Profit and operational efficiency are affected by parameter changes, highlighting trade-offs between cost, flexibility, and welfare.

## Conclusions

- The system shows resilience to minor variations in less influential parameters.  
- Targeted optimization of high-impact parameters (electricity prices, demand patterns, start-up/shut-down costs) is essential to enhance flexibility, reduce discomfort costs, and improve social welfare.  
- Sensitivity analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders in system planning and operational decision-making.
